## **SDK Integration**

This section explains the step by step guide on how to set up and integrate the BlockID SDK in an iOS application. 

:::tip 
The examples provided below demonstrate the integration steps of the BlockID SDK into a new iOS project

The same steps can also be used for integration into an existing application
:::

:::note Screenshots in this section are generated using Xcode 13.0.
:::


### Step 1: Create a New Application

- Open `Xcode`
- Select *File -> New -> Project*
- Choose *Single View Application* template
- Press *Next*


<img src={iOS3} />



- We are using **BlockID Demo** for our *Product Name* 
- Leave all the other settings as default

<img src={iOS4} />


- Press *Next* and select a location to save your project

- Press *Create*, and the project will be opened as shown below

<img src={iOS7} />

### Step 2: Setup CocoaPods

#### 2.1 Install CocoaPods

Installing the BlockID iOS SDK via <a href='http://cocoapods.org/' target='_blank'>CocoaPods</a>automates the majority of the installation process for you. Before beginning this process, please ensure that you are using <a href='https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/installation/' target='_blank'>Ruby 2.0.0</a> or greater. 

- Open a terminal and issue the following command to install CocoaPods

```shell 
sudo gem install cocoapods
```

<img src={iOS11} />


#### 2.2 Construct the Podfile

Now that you have installed the CocoaPods, the next step is to create an empty file in your Xcode project directory named `Podfile`

- Using the terminal, `cd` to your BlockID Demo root directory 
- Run the following command to create a Podfile

```shell
touch Podfile
```

- Confirm that the `Podfile` was created by navigating to the BlockID Demo root

<img src={iOS12} />

### Step 3: Add BlockID SDK

#### 3.1 CocoaPods Integration (Recommended)

:::note 
Installation of BlockID iOS SDK using Cocoapods is supported from version 1.6.00 only
:::

##### 3.1.1 Add BlockID SDK Library

Add the following lines to your `Podfile`:

```shell title="Podfile"
target 'BlockID Demo' do
    pod 'BlockIDSDK', :git => 'https://github.com/1KBlockID/ios-blockidsdk.git', :tag => '1.6.00'
end
```

##### 3.1.2 Install BlockID SDK

To install the BlockID SDK as a pod, navigate to the root directory of your BlockID Demo project within your terminal and run the following command:

```shell
pod install
```

:::note 
All BlockID SDK dependencies will be installed at this time
:::

<img src={iOS14} />


#### 3.2 Manual Integration

BlockID iOS SDK **versions 1.6.00 and *lower*** must be installed and integrated manually. 

##### 3.2.1 Download BlockID SDK 

- If currently open, close the *BlockID Demo* project in Xcode

- Using the terminal, clone the latest version of the BlockID SDK using `git`

```shell
git clone https://github.com/1KBlockID/ios-blockidsdk.git
``` 
- Copy the entire `BlockIDSDK.framework` folder to your *BlockID Demo* root directory

<img src={iOS17} />

- Using `Finder`, double-click the `BlockID Demo.xcworkspace` file in the same directory 

- `Xcode` will open. Select *BlockID Demo* under *Targets* and select *General -> Frameworks, Libraries and Embedded Content*

<img src={iOS15} />

- Click *+* to add `BlockIDSDK.framework`
- Once the framework is added, select *Embed & Sign* for `BlockIDSDK.framework`

<img src={iOS18} />

- The BlockID SDK uses <a href='https://developer.apple.com/documentation/cryptotokenkit' target='_blank'>CryptoTokenKit.framework</a>. The framework must be linked as *Optional* in the application target *Build Phase*

<img src={iOS20} />

<img src={iOS21} />

##### 3.2.2 Adding required iOS libraries 

The BlockID SDK has additional dependencies that must be installed. Open the `Podfile` (created during `Step 2.2`) and add the following: 

```shell title="Podfile"
# Uncomment the next line to define a global platform for your project
# Set iOS version as per project requirement
# BlockID SDK support is from iOS 11.0
# set the iOS version as per project requirement
platform :ios, '11.0'

target 'BlockID Demo' do
  # Comment the next line if you don't want to use dynamic frameworks
  use_frameworks!

  # Pods for BlockIDTestApp
  pod 'TrustWalletCore', '~> 2.5.6'
  pod 'Alamofire','~> 4.9.1'
  pod 'CryptoSwift', '~> 1.3.0'
  pod 'BigInt', '~> 4.0'
  pod 'SwiftyTesseract', '~> 3.1.3'
  pod 'OpenSSL-Universal', '~> 1.1.180'
  pod 'Toast-Swift', '~> 5.0.1'
end

post_install do |installer|
  installer.pods_project.targets.each do |target|
    target.build_configurations.each do |config|
      # build active architecture only
      config.build_settings['ONLY_ACTIVE_ARCH'] = 'YES'

      # set iOS Deployment Target to 11.0 or as per project requirement
      config.build_settings['IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET'] = '11.0'
    end
  end
end
```

##### 3.2.2 Install Pods

To install all the dependent pods, `cd` to the BlockID Demo root directory using the `Terminal` and run the following:

```shell 
pod install 
```

<img src={iOS19} />

### Step 4: Enable Bitcode

For iOS apps, bitcode is enabled by default but is optional. The BlockID SDK supports enabling bitcode option in the application. 

### Step 5: Enable Permissions 

Add the following permissions to your application. The value for each key must be changed as per your project requirement: 

```jsx 
// for NFC reading capability during passport scan
<key>NFCReaderUsageDescription</key>
<string>Allow permission in order to scan your passport</string>

// custom message to show during NFC reading
<key>NFCUserMessageDuringRFIDScan</key>
<string>Hold your iPhone near an NFC enabled passport.</string>

// set camera usage description
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>Enable camera access to enable Live id and document scanning</string>

// set FaceID usage description
<key>NSFaceIDUsageDescription</key>
<string>Face ID is needed to log in</string>

// set location usage description
<key>NSLocationAlwaysAndWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>Your current location will be required.</string>

// set location usage description
<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>Your current location will be required.</string>

// set photo library usage description
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>Enable photo libarary to save screenshots</string>

// set NFC reading identifier; the value must be same as given here
<key>com.apple.developer.nfc.readersession.iso7816.select-identifiers</key>
<array>
  <string>A0000002471001</string>
</array>
```

### Step 6: Add Near Field Communication Tag

Add Near Field Communication tag to the project capability. This is required if application will use Passport scan feature.  

Add the option from application's *`Target -> Signing & Capabilities`* and then click the *`+`* icon.  Search for *Near Field Communication* and add it to the project capabilities 

<img src={iOS22} />

### Step 7: Application Deployment 

iOS applications require proper Xcode configuration. As the current version of BlockID iOS SDK (`version 1.6.00`) is *FAT framework*, a workaround is provided below for an `iOS App Store` submission bug that appears when archiving universal binaries is required on your project. 

The script below removes the `iOS Simulator` architecture from the `.ipa` file, which creates issues when archiving for an `App Store` submission. 

- Create a new *Run Script Phase* in the application target *Build Phases* 
- Rename the script to `Framework Thinning` (optional)
- Paste the following in the script text field:

```shell title="Framework Thinning"
APP_PATH="${TARGET_BUILD_DIR}/${WRAPPER_NAME}"

# This script loops through the frameworks embedded in the application and
# removes unused architectures.
find "$APP_PATH" -name '*.framework' -type d | while read -r FRAMEWORK
do
    FRAMEWORK_EXECUTABLE_NAME=$(defaults read "$FRAMEWORK/Info.plist" CFBundleExecutable)
    FRAMEWORK_EXECUTABLE_PATH="$FRAMEWORK/$FRAMEWORK_EXECUTABLE_NAME"

    if [ ! -f "${FRAMEWORK_EXECUTABLE_PATH}" ]; then
        continue
    fi

    if xcrun lipo -info "${FRAMEWORK_EXECUTABLE_PATH}" | grep --silent "Non-fat"; then
        echo "Framework non-fat, skipping: $FRAMEWORK_EXECUTABLE_NAME"
        continue
    fi

    echo "Thinning framework $FRAMEWORK_EXECUTABLE_NAME"

    EXTRACTED_ARCHS=()

    for ARCH in $ARCHS
    do
        echo "Extracting $ARCH from $FRAMEWORK_EXECUTABLE_NAME"
        xcrun lipo -extract "$ARCH" "$FRAMEWORK_EXECUTABLE_PATH" -o "$FRAMEWORK_EXECUTABLE_PATH-$ARCH"
        EXTRACTED_ARCHS+=("$FRAMEWORK_EXECUTABLE_PATH-$ARCH")
    done

    echo "Merging extracted architectures: ${ARCHS}"
    xcrun lipo -o "$FRAMEWORK_EXECUTABLE_PATH-merged" -create "${EXTRACTED_ARCHS[@]}"
    rm "${EXTRACTED_ARCHS[@]}"

    echo "Replacing original executable with thinned version"
    rm "$FRAMEWORK_EXECUTABLE_PATH"
    mv "$FRAMEWORK_EXECUTABLE_PATH-merged" "$FRAMEWORK_EXECUTABLE_PATH"
done
```

### Step 8: Run the Application  

The setup of the application to include the BlockID SDK is now complete. The project can now be compiled to check for any errors. 

:::tip
Encryption of data takes longer while the app runs in *Debug* mode. It is recommended (but not mandatory) to change the application scheme to *Release* before running the application
:::

## **Initial SDK Setup** 

The SDK is now added to your application. In order to get the features of the SDK, you need to add your `License Key`, your `Wallet`, and your `Tenant` details. 

:::caution
The information must be set using the following sequence only and **MUST NOT** be changed
:::

:::tip
Refer to the <a href="/mobile-sdk/api-reference" target="_blank">API Reference Guide</a> to get more details on the methods used in this section
:::

### Step 1: Set License Key

The license key must be called **each time** the application is launched. Internally, the SDK checks if:

- The given license key is valid
- The application is authorized to use the given license key 

To set the license key, add the following code in your application:

```jsx 
BlockIDSDK.sharedInstance.setLicenseKey(key: "<your_license_key>")
```

### Step 2: Initialize Wallet 

Before registering tenant, a temporary application wallet must be created. An application can only have one wallet, hence the temporary wallet must be created **ONLY once**.

Add the following code to initialize a temporary wallet:

```shell 
BlockIDSDK.sharedInstance.initiateTempWallet() { (status, error) in
  //your code here
}
```

### Step 3: Register Tenant

#### 3.1 About Tenant 

The tenant can be represented as the value or an object on which API calls can be registered. 

There are two types of tenants: 

- Root Tenant: stores details about enrolled user biometric informatiom and digital assets  
- Client Tenant: stores user's enrolled persona

:::note 
A root tenant can also store a user's persona, but a client tenant cannot be used to store biometric data or digital assets 
:::

The application is expected to register a tenant **only once**. If an existing tenant is set, the application will load it after validating the license key.

The SDK will only allow a tenant to be registered after the license key is set. 

The tenant object is represented using the `BIDTenant` class, and can be created using the following code:

```shell 
let defaultTenant = BIDTenant.makeTenant(tag:"<tenant tag>", community: "<community name>", dns: "<tenant DNS>")
```

#### 3.2 Register Tenant 

After the object `BIDTenant`is created the tenant registration API must be called:

```shell 
BlockIDSDK.sharedInstance.registerTenant(tenant: BIDTenant) { (status, error, tenant) in
  // your code here
}
```

The tenant details will be used while enrolling documents, or when getting a public key. When this function is executed, an Ethereum wallet is created and a *Distributed Identifier (DID)*, along with *12 recovery Mnemonic phrases* will be avaible to the user. 

### Step 4: Commit Wallet

Upon successful tenant registration, the commit wallet method must be called. The method must be called **only once**:

```shell 
BlockIDSDK.sharedInstance.commitApplicationWallet()
```

The commit wallet method is the final step for setting up BlockID SDK into an iOS application.

## SDK Security 

Because the attack surface of an API is wider than that of a standlone application. the BlockID SDK has implemented a locking mechanism to prevent any kind of unauthorized access. 

For security purposes, the points below must be implemented in the application:

- SDK should be locked when the application moves into background state
- SDK should be locked when application shows login screen to Users
- SDK lock status should be checked before calling any enrollment APIs
