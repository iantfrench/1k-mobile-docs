# WebAuthn 

WebAuthn allows users to login and authenticate using standard FIDO2 security keys (YubiKeys) and platform authenticators (device biometrics).

## **How it Works**

After logging in initially, users can register a compatible FIDO2 device to their account to act as an authenticator. This can be a hardware device (roaming authenticator), such as a YubiKey, or native device biometrics (platform authenticator), such as TouchID and FaceID. 

After registering an authenticator, users can authenticate their identity with their enrolled device as part of your login experience.  


### Requirements

- BlockID SDK - installed and initialized with license key and tenant information.
- Compatible FIDO2 device - this can be a hardware key, such as a YubiKey, or a device with built-in biometrics, such as a mobile device.

See [Getting Started](/docs#gettingstarted) for more information on installing and initializng the BlockID SDK.
