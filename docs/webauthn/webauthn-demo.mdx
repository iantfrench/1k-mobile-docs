# WebAuthn Demo Application

We've created a demo application using the <a href="/devportal/webauthn/nodejs-example" target="_blank">BlockID NodeJS SDK</a> and ReactJS.

## **Overview of the WebAuthn Demo Application**

Here's a brief overview of the steps required to register and authenticate FIDO devices on our <a href="/devportal/demo/?tab=fidowebauthn" target="_blank">webauthn demo application</a>:

## **Step 1: Register a Security Key or Platform Authenticator**

The registration steps vary slightly depending on whether you wish to register a security key or a platform authenticator. 

Not sure which?

**Examples of security keys:**
- YubiKey
- Google TitanKey

**Examples of platform authenticators:**
- Apple TouchID and FaceID
- Windows Hello
- Built-in biometrics on your mobile device 


### Register a Security Key

Enter a `username` in the box on the left (under *Step 1 Register*) - this can be any unique username that has not already been used to register a device on this page.  

For this demo, we are going with the name `JohnDoe`:

<img src={RegisterKey1} height="250" />

After typing in your username, click the **Setup security key** button. 

A message from your browser will pop up asking you to insert your security key and touch it.   

<img src={RegisterKey2} height="250" />

Insert your security key and touch it as instructed by the browser to complete the device registration.  

The pop-up message will update to display a message confirming that you have successfully registered your security key. 

### Register a Platform Authenticator 

Enter a `username` in the box on the left, under *Step 1 Register*. This can be any unique username that has not already been used to register a device on this page.  

Because we already used the name `JohnDoe` to register a security key, we are going to use the name `JohnDoe2` for this demo, using a Macbook Pro as our Platform Authenticator:

<img src={RegisterPlatformAuthenticator1} height="250" />

After entering your username, click the *Setup platform authenticator* button. 

A browser message will pop up asking you to confirm your identity with the built-in device biometrics. Since we are using a MacBook Pro with Apple TouchID, we see a message asking us to scan our fingerprint (or to enter a password):

<img src={RegisterPlatformAuthenticator2} height="250" />

After scanning our fingerprint, we will see a message stating that our device was successfully registered. 

## **Step 2: Authenticate**

After registering a security key or platform authenticator, we can now use the device we registered to authenticate. 

Enter the `username` you used to register your device in *Step 1* in the box on the right, under *Step 2 Authenticate*. 

We are going to authenticate using our MacBook, which we registered with the username `JohnDoe2`: 

<img src={Authenticate} height="250" />

After entering your username, click the *Login with fido key* button. A browser message will pop up again, asking you to authenticate the FIDO device. 

This will be identical to the process used when registering the device: 

##### Security Keys
For *security keys*, such as a YubiKey, you will see the message asking you to insert your key and touch the device: 

<img src={RegisterKey2} height="250" />

##### Platform Authenticators
For *platform authenticators*, such as Apple TouchID on a Macbook Pro, you will see the message asking you to scan your fingerprint (or else type in a password): 

<img src={RegisterPlatformAuthenticator2} height="250" />

After authenticating your device, you will see a message pop-up confirming the demo login was successful:

<img src={Success} height="250" />
